# Pok3r Programming

## Overview

Welcome to the wonderful world of Pok3r keyboard programming! If you're coming from the HHKB world as I am, you'll be happy to find that I'm going to provide a setup that should closely mirror the programming and UNIX-friendly layout that you have gotten use to.

So first, some basics.

## General Information

In order to start programming your Pok3r keyboard, you'll need to learn a few basics. First, we'll be referring to the red and blue LEDs under the spacebar as the 'spacebar LED' from here on out. Don't forget!

You'll also need to remember a few shortcut commands in case you break everything, and need to start a little fresh, or a lot of fresh. First the user manual can be found here.

### How the Layers Work

First off, there are 4 layers to your new Pok3r keyboard. The first, base layer cannot be programmed. Each of the other layers (2 -4), can be reprogrammed with a different set of remapped keys. Most people use these different layers to modify keys for different operating systems.

### General Commands and Guidance

* Factory reset: Hold down both left and right `ALT` keys.
* Reset current layer only: `FN + R` until spacebar LED stops flashing.
* The default layer cannot be programmed

In order to re-assign your keys, you'll need to first activate the appropriate layer:

* `FN + ,` for Layer 2 (Windows)
* `FN + .` for Layer 3 (OSX)

Then, you'll hit `FN + R_Ctrl`, which should activate the second LED undernearth the spacebar. This LED means that you can program a key. Hit the `target key` first, then enter `target content`, then tap `PN` to complete the transaction. The second LED will blink for the duration of the key programming, and will cease when you tap `PN`.

Make sure that you use the keys as labelled on the keyboard during programming, no matter what they've been re-assigned.

## Red Layer 3: OSX

Let's get layer 3 set up with some keybindings that will help us navigate the OSX/Linux world. Activate that layer with `FN + .`.


### Common Bindings


### The Great Escape

I don't personally take this step, but I wanted to mention it because it's pretty handy for heavy `\`` and `~` users. Following these steps will get you the following:

* Pressing the physical version of the escape key will get you `\``.
* Pressing `shift` + `EST` will yield `~`.
* `FN` + `ESC` will give you the actual escape key.

First, press `FN` + `R_Ctrl` to enter programming mode, which will illuminate the spacebar LED.

Press `ESC`, then `FN` + `ESC`. 

Press `PN` to complete the programming.

Next press `FN` + `ESC`, then `ESC`. Press `PN` again to complete the programming.

Tap `FN` + `R_Ctrl` to exit programming mode.

### No One Likes Caps Lock


### Move the Function

## Blue Layer 2: Windows

To program this layer, connect to it with `FN + ,<`.
