# Pok3r Programming

## Overview

Welcome to the wonderful world of Pok3r keyboard programming! If you're coming from the HHKB world as I am, you'll be happy to find that I'm going to provide a setup that should closely mirror the programming and UNIX-friendly layout that you have gotten use to.

So first, some basics.

## General Information

In order to start programming your Pok3r keyboard, you'll need to learn a few basics. First, we'll be referring to the red and blue LEDs under the spacebar as the 'spacebar LED' from here on out. Don't forget!

You'll also need to remember a few shortcut commands in case you break everything, and need to start a little fresh, or a lot of fresh. First the user manual can be found here.

### General Commands

* Factory reset: Hold down both left and right `ALT` keys.
* Reset current layer only: `FN + R` until spacebar LED stops flashing.
