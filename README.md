# Pok3r Programming

## Overview

Welcome to the wonderful world of Pok3r keyboard programming! If you're coming from the HHKB world as I am, you'll be happy to find that I'm going to provide a setup that should closely mirror the programming and UNIX-friendly layout that you have gotten use to.

So first, some basics.

## General Information

In order to start programming your Pok3r keyboard, you'll need to learn a few basics. First, we'll be referring to the red and blue LEDs under the spacebar as the 'spacebar LED' from here on out. Don't forget!

You'll also need to remember a few shortcut commands in case you break everything, and need to start a little fresh, or a lot of fresh. First the user manual can be found here.

### How the Layers Work

First off, there are 4 layers to your new Pok3r keyboard. The first, base layer cannot be programmed. Each of the other layers (2 -4), can be reprogrammed with a different set of remapped keys. Most people use these different layers to modify keys for different operating systems.

### General Commands

* Factory reset: Hold down both left and right `ALT` keys.
* Reset current layer only: `FN + R` until spacebar LED stops flashing.

### Blue Layer 2: Windows


### Red Layer 3: OSX


### Common Bindings


### The Great Escape

Switch to layer 2. (or any other layer you wish to use)

Press FN+R_control to enter programming mode, which will illuminate the spacebar LED to indicate that you're in programming mode.
Press ESC. This is to indicate the physical key you want to remap for a new key or function. The LED will begin to flash.
Press FN+ESC. This is the NEW key or function you are assigning to the physical key you pressed in the previous step.
Press PN to finish assigning NEW key or functions to the physical ESC key. The LED will stop flashing.
Press FN+R_control to exit programming mode. The LED will turn off.
